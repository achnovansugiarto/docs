This section describes general mounting requirements and guides through installation process for permanent use in vehicles. 

## Mounting Requirements
To benefit from all ModuCop features, proper mouting in permanent vehicle installation is essential.

> Please use Ci4Rail's accessories for mounting 

### Mounting Orientation
When mounted in wall or DIN-rail assembly, the following mounting orientations are possible:

Horizontal Mounting:

Vertical Mounting: 

![ModuCop Edge Computer]({{ '/user-docs/images/edge-solutions/moducop/mounting/mount_vertical1.png' | relative_url }})


In order to enable proper heat dissipation, the Edge Computer shall be mounted horizontally with a maximum tilt in the direction of the connector front of 30Â°.

Please avoid mounting which prevents heat dissipation:

### Keep Free Areas
Due to the fact, that ModuCop is fully passive cooled, the installation shall enable natural air convection by clearance areas by given distances to neighbor equipment on top and bottom of the ModuCop.

The following figures show clearence areas depending on choosen mounting:
