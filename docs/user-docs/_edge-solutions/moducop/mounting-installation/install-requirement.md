This section gives installation requirements and guidance on how ModuCop has to be installed to enable proper and safe operation.


## Electrical Installation Requirements 

### External Fuse

> Do not use ModuCop without an external fuse! If you are unsure, which fuse type and characteristics to choose, contact Ci4Rail.
{: .notice--danger}

The following table describes the requirements to the fuse depending on the nominal input voltage of your power system. 

|Nominal Voltage |Required Fuse|
|:--------------:|:-----------:|
|24V DC | 2,5A melting bla|
|36V DC| 2,5A melting bla|
|48V DC | 2,5A melting bla|
|72V DC | 2,5A melting bla|
|110V DC | 2,5A melting bla|


### Earthing
ModuCop is a protection class I device (protective earth). 

> It is mandatory to connect protective earth first and disconnect last for any installation action! 
{: .notice--danger}

Use proper components and cable equipment to establish a safe and stable earth connection. 

Protective earth bolt is located on the front of installed power supply unit.

## Mechanical Installation Requirements
To benefit from all ModuCop features, proper mounting in permanent vehicle installation is essential.

> Please use Ci4Rail's accessories for mounting

### Mounting Orientation
When mounted in wall or DIN-rail assembly, the following mounting orientations are possible:

Horizontal Mounting

Vertical Mounting

In order to enable proper heat dissipation, the Edge Computer shall be mounted horizontally with a maximum tilt in the direction of the connector front of 30Â°.

Please avoid mounting which prevents heat dissipation!

### Keep Free Areas
Since ModuCop is completely passively cooled, the installation must allow for natural air convection through clearances with specific distances to adjacent equipment.

The following figures show clearence areas depending on choosen mounting:
