This section gives installation requirements and guidance on how ModuCop has to be installed to enable proper and safe operation.


## Electrical Installation Requirements 

### External Fuse

> Do not use ModuCop without an EXTERNAL FUSE! If you are unsure, which fuse type and characteristics to choose, contact Ci4Rail.
{: .notice--danger}

The following table describes the requirements to the fuse depending on the nominal input voltage of your power system. 

|Nominal Voltage |Required Fuse|
|:--------------:|:-----------:|
|24V DC | 2.5A medium time-lag|
|36V DC| 1.6A medium time-lag|
|110V DC | 1A medium time-lag|


### Earthing
ModuCop is a protection class I device (protective earth). 

> It is mandatory to connect protective earth first and disconnect last for any installation action! 
{: .notice--danger}

Use proper components and cable equipment to establish a safe and stable earth connection. 

Protective earth bolt is located on the front of installed power supply unit.

## Mechanical Installation Requirements
To benefit from all ModuCop features, proper mounting in permanent vehicle installation is essential.

> Please use Ci4Rail's accessories for mounting

### Mounting Orientation
When mounted in wall or DIN rail assembly, the following mounting orientations are possible:

Horizontal Mounting

Vertical Mounting

![ModuCop Edge Computer]({{ '/user-docs/images/edge-solutions/moducop/mount/mount_vertical1.png' | relative_url }})


In order to enable proper heat dissipation, the Edge Computer shall be mounted horizontally with a maximum tilt in the direction of the connector front of 30Â°.

Please avoid mounting which prevents heat dissipation!

### Keep Free Areas
Since ModuCop is completely passively cooled, the installation must allow for natural air convection through clearances with specific distances to adjacent equipment.

> Keep free areas apply to any mounting option 
{: .notice--info}


The following figures show clearence areas:

- Top & bottom areas to be kept free from further installations

- Left & right areas to be kept free from further installations
