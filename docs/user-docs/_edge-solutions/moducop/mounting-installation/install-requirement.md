This section gives installation requirements and guidance on how ModuCop has to be installed to enable proper and safe operation.


## Electrical Installation Requirements 

### External Fuse
> Do not use ModuCop w/o exernal fuse! If you are unsure, which fuse type and characteristics to choose, contact Ci4Rail. 

The following table describes the requirements to the fuse depending on the nominal input voltage of your power system. 

|Nominal Voltage |Required Fuse|
|:--------------:|:-----------:|
|24V (DC) | 2,5A melting bla|
|36V (DC) | 2,5A melting bla|
|48V (DC) | 2,5A melting bla|
|72V (DC) | 2,5A melting bla|
|110V (DC) | 2,5A melting bla|


### Earthing
ModuCop is a protection class I device (protective earth). 
> It is mandatory to connect protective earth first and disconnect last for any installation action!

Use proper components and cable equipment to establish a safety and stable earth connection.
- Stromfestigkeit
- Kabelquerschnitt


## Mechanical Installation Requirements
To benefit from all ModuCop features, proper mouting in permanent vehicle installation is essential.

> Please use Ci4Rail's accessories for mounting 

### Mounting Orientation
When mounted in wall or DIN-rail assembly, the following mounting orientations are possible:

Horizontal Mounting:

Vertical Mounting: 

![ModuCop Edge Computer]({{ '/user-docs/images/edge-solutions/moducop/mounting/mount_vertical1.png' | relative_url }})


In order to enable proper heat dissipation, the Edge Computer shall be mounted horizontally with a maximum tilt in the direction of the connector front of 30Â°.

Please avoid mounting which prevents heat dissipation:

### Keep Free Areas
Due to the fact, that ModuCop is fully passive cooled, the installation shall enable natural air convection by clearance areas by given distances to neighbor equipment on top and bottom of the ModuCop.

The following figures show clearence areas depending on choosen mounting:
