WELCOME to the edge solutions User-Documentation.

Ci4Rail's edge solutions are intended to be installed in rail and automotive vehicles to acquire, transform, process, transmit vehicle data from various types, like sensor data, field bus data or diagnosis data. 

To access data exactly where they happen, Ci4Rail offers both Edge Computers as well as Sensors & Converters for decentralized data acquisition.

The following sections show the user documentation of each kind.
