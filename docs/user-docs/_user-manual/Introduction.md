Welcome to the KYT introduction, first of all: What does KYT mean?

# **KYT** stands for **K**now **Y**our **T**rain

... and this is what you get by using Ci4Rail's products. You are enabled to massivly raise transparency of your vehicles and raise the value of your asssets.
Transparency about the condition of electronic systems such as brakes, doors, air conditioning, restroom etc. is the basic pre-requisite for continuous optimization. With KYT you operate a modular, flexible, scalable computer and service concept for use in the vehicle and in the cloud to make data and thus the status of all systems centrally accessible. **ONE computer platform for all applications**.

# KYT Target Applications
KYT is a generic platform, which can be used for any operator or passenger asset application. Nevertheless it focuses on applications in rail and public transport where data shall be used to increase the value of a certain asset, especially: 
- Condition based monitoring 
- Predictive maintenance
- Fleet optimization 

.. in the end, KYT helps you to increase transparency and system availablity and lowers your operational costs. 



# KYT Components
KYT is a complete sensor to cloud solution consisting of both *Edge* and *Cloud* components. The following graphic shows a high level architecture of KYT.

KYT's major parts are: 
- [Edge Solutions]({{ '/user-manual/edge-solutions/' | relative_url }}) consisting of 
    - [*ModuCop*]({{ '/user-manual/edge-solutions/moducop/' | relative_url }}) edge computer
    - [*Sensors/Converters*]({{ '/user-manual/edge-solutions/sensors-converters/' | relative_url }}) to generate new or to apply to existing data
     
- Cloud Services called  [*EdgeFarm*]({{ '/user-manual/edgefarm//' | relative_url }}) including
    - *DLM* - Device LifeCycle Management
    - *ALM* - Application LifeCycle Management  
    - *ADS* - Application Data Service 


Even if KYT generates it's greatest benefits as a complete sensor to cloud solution, the product has been design in a modular way to allow single components to be integrated in any existing customer environment. It can be use to close functional gaps or to solve the complete value chain from analysis to analytics.
